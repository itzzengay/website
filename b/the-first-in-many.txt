After some thought I finally decided to make my very own blog. I needed a place to write some guides, blogs, and other stuff that I feel would be better put as a long form blog post rather than a post on my fediverse account. I'll setup RSS later and I'll announce it when that's avalible but for now I'm playing around with this.

As the title implies, this has not been my first attempt at a blog before. Numerous times have I made one then deleted one, although I feel this time I actually have a sense of direction and hopefully will last way longer than the other attempts.

Thanks for reading!
