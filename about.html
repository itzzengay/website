	<h1>My hyperfixations</h1>
	<p>My autism and adhd has given me the benefit on hypixating on many things that are probably useless but I'm going to </p>
	<h2>Physical formats</h2>
	<p>One thing I've gotten very focused on recently is building out how to consume media using only physical formats, completley removing streaming services from my life. And I've mostly figured out what formats I'm going to utilize for my physical formats. For video, HD-DVD, Blu-ray, and DVD will be used (priortiy highest to lowest) and for Music it's Vinyl. I do think that owning the physical versions of these things are better than just streaming it online. I feel more connected to what I'm watching, and the bonus content that comes with physical things just makes it so much better.</p>
	<h3>HD-DVD</h3>
	<p>HD-DVD was a format developed by Toshiba in 2002 released 2006 and discontinued in 2008. This format was the competitor for the HD video format against Blu-ray, which ended up winning the video format war after Sony's bold play with the PlayStation 3 having a Blu-ray player built in. Now, why does this neice abandoned video format have its own section? Because that's one of my hyperfixations silly! Yeah, for some reason my autism gravitated towards this format just because of the "cool factor" of the HD-DVD name and other things about it.</p>
	<h2>Computers</h2>
	<p>The hyperfixation that will never die off, I'm always learning something new about computers every day becuase that's what I enjoy best! So far I've broken a couple computers, built 2 custom PCs, went through a few laptops in my life, and have very strong opinions on specific software... But most importantly, I've had a lot of fun with computers and other tech related things!</p>
</div>

<div class="main">
	<h1>Hardware and software I use!</h1>
	<p>Like any computer nerd, they have a specific list of software and hardware they use on their website, nya nya! :3c.</p>
	<h2>Hardware</h2>
	<p>For my phone: Pixel 6a. This phone gets the job done, even though its display's color balance is whack because I dropped it face down on the floor, whoops! At the moment it runs GrapheneOS and I get to customize it to my hearts content. To summarize; it's a phone that works for my needs :).</p>
	<p>For my laptop: Thinkpad L14 Gen1 AMD. This laptop also is like my phone, is that it gets the job done. This laptop is what gets me through school and mostly anything that doesn't need a whole lot of horsepower. It's a good design and I plan on stickerbombing it later on, however it "just works" on Fedora Linux Silverblue which is neat.</p>
	<p>For the desktop: Custom built PC. Now <i>this</i> is where anything powerful goes if my two prior devices can't handle it. It plays games very well, VR is amazing, and it's blazing fast. Sadly it is currently using Windows 11 due to a issue with the network driver on linux. But it's powerful so I'm not too concerned with the overhead.</p>
	<h2>Software</h2>
	<p>Operating Systems: Linux, duh! I'm a techie catigrl :3, it is a rock stable OS with customization galore, it may not be the most secure in the world but that's okay. It gets the job well and doesn't nag me when I'm doing things.</p>
	<p>Desktop Enviroments: Gnome. Simple, sleek, and not that customizable, which is actually a benefit funny enough. I always get distracted customizing things and having something that doens't present every single theming setting at me is actually a good thing. (I literally cannot use KDE because of the theme settings being so much)</p>
	<p>Browser: Chromium. It's simple and sleek and secure. My threat model doesn't yearn for something like Tor Browser and I need something stable and fast so Chromium it is. I do not like that it is contributing to the Chromium monopoly though, however Firefox has been horrible for me in the past.</p>

<div class="main">
	<h1>My favorite things!</h1>
	<p>I have a few things I like over others, those things are listed here.</p>
	<h2>Music related</h2>
	<h3>Album</h3>
	<p>Queens of the Stone Age's Songs for the Deaf. It's a great rock album, it takes you on trip through differnt radio stations and its a great charm when listening to the album front to back. "It's song for the deaf, you can't even hear it!" It's such a great listen, every track is an absolute banger, highly reccomend.</p>
	<h3>Band</h3>
	<p>Weezer. Yes I'm a weezer fan, sorry /s. Most of their discography is really good to me, something I can definitley listen to (yes even I enjoy <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8614-make-believe/">Make Believe</a> (pitchfork you're out of your minds with dat rating lmao).</a></p>
