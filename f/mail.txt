WELCOME
=======
This is my email server's (ugly but useful) web portal! Here is where you can find information about my email server!

REGISTERING
===========
In order to make an email account on my email server, you have to pay this ammount of BTC or XMR:

BTC = 0.00008
XMR = 0.019

Please send me an xmpp or email message at itzzenxx@itzzen.net and I will give you a BTC or XMR wallet. Once I recive the BTC or XMR, I will give you the username and password needed to sign in.

USING EMAIL
===========
For configuring email clients, the current ports and security configurations are as follows:

IMAP:
- PORT: 993
- SECURITY: SSL/TLS
- SERVER: itzzen.net
SMTP:
- PORT: 465
- SECURITY: SSL/TLS
- SERVER: itzzen.net

Email clients I reccomend are Mozilla Thunderbird, Claws Mail, and Mutt.

TRUSTING ME
===========
"Can I trust you with keeping my emails private?"
No! While I don't read, sell, and spy on your emails. It is still possible for me to read emails stored on my server so you need to trust my word on this one. If you want better privacy, I reccomend encrypting your messages using OpenPGP and regulary deleting emails from my server.
